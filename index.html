        <h3>Welcome Errebody!</h3>

<p>Have you ever wanted to learn Japanese? Have you ever want to visit Japan? Are you generally interested in Japan and Japanese culture in general? Well then this app is for you. Otaku is an open-source app that is built for anyone keen on learning Japanese.</p>

<h3>iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad ready.</h3>

<p>This app is built for iOS devices, with Android support coming soon. This app was made from the ground up, using web pages for most of the lessons. By using web pages, we can include many more things other than just the features of iOS devices.</p>

<h3>Extra features!</h3>

<p>By implementing HTML webpage instead of native objects we can include more style and design.</p>

<h3>Looking for help.</h3>

<p>This project is hosted on GitHub because it is open-source. I am looking for some people to help my develop this app before it is submitted to Apple. I'm not very experienced in iOS development, but I can manage if nobody else wants to help. If you would like to help, please contact me in my email: <a href="mailto:aosamadesu@gmail.com">aosamadesu@gmail.com</a>.</p>
